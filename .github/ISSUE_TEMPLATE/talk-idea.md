**Is your talk about technology on AWS?**
A clear and concise description of what the talk is about Make sure you include:
- Synopsis
- Promise not to do a product pitch

**How long is your talk?**
Please try and keep talks to:
- 25 mins maximum
- We'd like to record a 5 min introduction with you

**Can you pre-record the content?**
When third parties do a presentation we like to have pre-recorded content. This free's up the presenter to answer questions in the chat and then take some live questions later.

**Can you provide the slides before he talk?**
We like to let participants download the slides after the talk but we need to prepare this.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the talk proposed here.
